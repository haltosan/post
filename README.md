This project is a collection of post modules I have made to make pentesting a bit more simple. Each has a 'local' and a 'deploy' 
file. The local is to be used on the attacking machine, the deploy is to be uploaded to the target. I will try to make it mostly in 
bash, but I prefer python, so there may be a lot more python.
